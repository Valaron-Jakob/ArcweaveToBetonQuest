# Arcweave To BetonQuest
A small pyscript to convert Arcweave dialogue to BetonQuest conversations


**How to use:**
* Export a selected Arcweave board as .json
-> ["Small Paperplane"] -> Select boards -> Your Conversation -> [Export]

Run the pyscript and follow the instructions in the console.

The result "quest_conversation.yml" is created in the same folder of your input .json

**Limitations:**
- Only elements and selections can be used right now (example screenshot)
- No Events, Conditions, etc. - only Conversations
- Arcweaves selections have no "titles", so the IDs are used in this version
- I'm sure there are bugs, so please report them if you dare to test this script for yourself ^^"
